Features to be added: 





_Create User Personas: Develop user personas representing your target audience. User personas help you understand user behavior, preferences, and pain points. This information will guide your design decisions._


_Sketching and Wireframing: Begin the design process by sketching rough ideas on paper or using digital tools. Convert these sketches into wireframes, which are basic visual representations of your app's layout and structure. Wireframes help you establish the app's navigation flow and overall structure._


_Design Mockups: Once the wireframes are finalized, create high-fidelity design mockups using graphic design software. Pay attention to visual aesthetics, typography, color schemes, and brand consistency. Design each screen and define the user interface (UI) elements._


_Prototype Development: Build interactive prototypes to simulate the app's functionality and user interactions. Prototypes allow you to test and validate your design concepts before investing in full development. Use prototyping tools like InVision, Figma, or Adobe XD.
Usability Testing: Conduct usability testing with a small group of target users. Gather feedback on the app's user experience (UX), identify areas of improvement, and make necessary changes to the design based on user insights._
